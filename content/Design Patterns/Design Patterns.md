Design Patterns are typical solutions to commonly occurring problems in software design. They are like pre-made blueprints that you can customize to solve a recurring design problem in your code.

## Classification of Patterns

3 main groups of patterns:
- [Creational patterns](../Design%20Patterns/Creational/Creational%20Patterns.md) provide object creation mechanisms that increase flexibility and reuse of existing code

- [Structural patterns](../Design%20Patterns/Structural/Structural%20Patterns.md) explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures, while keeping these structures flexible and efficient

- [Behavioral patterns](../Design%20Patterns/Behavioral/Behavioral%20Patterns.md) take care of effective communication and the assignment of responsibilities between objects
